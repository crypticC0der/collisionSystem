# collisionSystem
a simple collision system, with particles and strings<br>
it is only 2d as it was more of a test on using opengl than my mechanics skills<br>
<br>
the strings and paritcles are coloured differently with respect to the particles mass and strings elasticity<br>
the particles have variable mass, radius, initial position, velocity, both forces and acceleration can be applied<br>
strings can have variable natural length, elasticity,<br>
  they can be either strings or springs ann can be connected to a mix of particles and static positions<br>
